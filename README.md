# Energy-EdgeCloudSim: An Energy-Aware Edge Computing Simulator

**Energy-EdgeCloudSim** is an open-source simulator that extends the capabilities of [EdgeCloudSim](https://github.com/CagataySonmez/EdgeCloudSim) to incorporate energy consumption modeling. This allows researchers and developers to evaluate the energy efficiency of edge computing applications and infrastructures.

## Features

* **Energy Consumption Modeling:** Energy-EdgeCloudSim introduces energy models for various components of an edge computing environment, including edge servers, network devices, and mobile devices.
* **Realistic Workloads:**  The simulator supports the execution of real-world applications and workloads, enabling accurate energy consumption analysis.
* **Flexible Configuration:** Users can customize the simulation environment by defining the network topology, device specifications, and application parameters.
* **Detailed Results:** Energy-EdgeCloudSim provides comprehensive simulation results, including energy consumption metrics, performance indicators, and resource utilization data.

## Motivation

Energy efficiency is a critical concern in edge computing due to the distributed nature of edge devices and the increasing demand for computation-intensive applications. Energy-EdgeCloudSim provides a valuable tool for:

* **Algorithm Design:** Evaluating the energy efficiency of edge computing algorithms and resource management strategies.
